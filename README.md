# Train-Cityscape-data-using-Pretrained-Resnet-18-model-using-Discriminative-Learning
Train Cityscape data using Pretrained Resnet 18 model using Discriminative Learning using Pytorch

## Dataset:

**[Cityscapes Image Pairs](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/cityscapes-image-pairs)**

## Implementation:

* The Resnet18 pretrained model was used to do the semantic segmentation task using Pytorch.
* Due to lack of time I couldn't extend the implementation in FastAPI
* The detailed implementation can be found from the [colab notebook](https://github.com/sayan0506/DIscriminative-Learning-in-Semantic-Segmentation-on-Cityscape-Dataset/blob/main/Pretrained_Resnet_18_with_Discriminative_learning.ipynb) along with the documented step by step implementation guide.
